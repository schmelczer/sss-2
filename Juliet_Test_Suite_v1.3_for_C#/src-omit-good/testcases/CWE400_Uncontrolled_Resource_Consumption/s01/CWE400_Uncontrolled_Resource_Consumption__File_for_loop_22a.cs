 * CWE: 400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption
 * BadSource: File Read count from file (named c:\data.txt)
 * GoodSource: A hardcoded non-zero, non-min, non-max, even number
 * Sinks: for_loop
 *    GoodSink: Validate count before using it as the loop variant in a for loop
 *    BadSink : Use count as the loop variant in a for loop
 * Flow Variant: 22 Control flow: Flow controlled by value of a public static variable. Sink functions are in a separate file from sources.
