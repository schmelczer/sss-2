 * CWE: 129 Improper Validation of Array Index
 * BadSource: negative_fixed Set data to a negative value
 * GoodSource: A hardcoded non-zero, non-min, non-max, even number
 * Sinks: array_write_no_check
 *    GoodSink: Write to array after verifying index
 *    BadSink : Write to array without any verification of index
 * Flow Variant: 22 Control flow: Flow controlled by value of a public static variable. Sink functions are in a separate file from sources.
